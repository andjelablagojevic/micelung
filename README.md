This repository contains a partial implementation of the U-Net segmentation methodology used in our recent study. The published work focuses on segmenting lung sections in mice using a U-Net model.

Currently, a subset of the code is available for reference and reproducibility. The complete implementation will be uploaded to this repository after the publication of the associated research paper.

The segmentation experiments were conducted in Google Colab using Python and TensorFlow, with GPU acceleration.
