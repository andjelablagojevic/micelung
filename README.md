This repository contains a partial implementation of the segmentation methodology used in our recent study. The published U-Net model is responsible for segmenting lung sections in mouse lung images. The segmentation experiments were conducted in Google Colab using Python and TensorFlow, with GPU acceleration.

This code accompanies the paper:  
**"Transfer Learning with Limited Data for Mice Lung Segmentation in Synchrotron X-Ray Tomography"**  

Currently, a subset of the code is available for reference and reproducibility. The complete implementation will be uploaded to this repository after the publication of the associated research paper.
